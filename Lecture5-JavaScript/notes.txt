1 . django: allow us server-side code
javascript: allow us client-side code and manipulate the dom of a web page
2. <script> </script> : anything between script tags is javascript code
3. JavaScript is good for event-driven programming: click a button, select from a drop-down list, 
    scrolls down or submit a form. Javascript use event listeners
4. querySelector: to select the elements 
    ** variables and functions must not have the same names
5. use const with variables that never happen to change
6. dealing with listeners whose dom element has not been reached (DOMContentLoaded) 
7. move all your javascript code to a file: counter.html

8. create a form and display the name entered in an alert: hello_2.html
9. iterate over buttons and change color into a text: colors.html
10. arrow notation instead of "function(a)", "a => "
                            "function()", "() => "
11. another way to change color in a text using option selector: colors_1.html 
12. Events: onclick, onmouserover, onkeydown, onkeyup, onload, onblur
13. add an item list from submitting with good user experience: tasks.html
14. local storage, keep a value on your web browser: counter_1.html
15. currency api: currency.html.  Register and see documentation
